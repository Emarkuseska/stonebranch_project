1.The task was to read customer code form the file customer_file.csv, than find that code in the customer.csv database
get that row and write it in a new customer.csv databese.(do that to all 1000 customer codes from customer_file.csv)

2.Than read customer code form the file customer_file.csv, find that code in the invoice.csv database get that row and
write it in a new invoice.csv databese.(do that to all 1000 customer codes from customer_file.csv)

2.Than read invoice code form the new invoice file (made in step 2) New_invoice.csv, find that code in the
invoice_item.csv database get that row and write it in a new invoice_item.csv databese.
(do that to all invoice codes from the new invoice file)

In find_data_func.py there is a function find_data that finds the wanted data and adds it to a new database.
Because the task was to do these steps in this order there is another function in find_data_func.py called
make_new_databases that calls the function find_data three times. The function has one parameter name1.
In the parameter name1 is stored the name of the csv file with customer codes that we want to find in the other files.
(The make_new_databases function can be used only when the three files customer.csv, invoice.csv and invoice_item.csv
are in the python project file)
In the find_data function in find_data_func there is only one try block for the name1, because the other names are
already written in the make_new_databases function.

The task can be done from main_program.py just with writing the name of the file with the customer codes
so the input has to be customer_file.csv.

There are two more python files in this project
find_data_finally.py that contains the same function find_data that does the same thing but you can use it with any two
databases, even with databases that are not in the python project folder.

finding_data_withCSV.py contains the function make_new_data. In this file is used inport csv. This function can be used
with any two database,even with databases that are not in the python project folder.

You can find the explanation of the find_data function in the comments in find_data_finally.py and finding_data_withCSV.py
